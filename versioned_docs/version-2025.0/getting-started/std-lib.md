# `Standard` Library

Like most languages, Drift must implement a standard library
implementing basic types and utilities.

:::warning
At this moment, Drift does not implement a ``Standard`` library,
but implements builtin types with hard-coded definitions in runner.

Drift will clean and implement this library in a future release.
